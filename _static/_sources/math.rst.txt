Some sample math
================

Here is some sample math added to this page as an inline directive :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

Here is some math added to this page:

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

And another...

.. math::

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2

And another...

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}

And some more...

.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
beautiful mathematical formulas.
