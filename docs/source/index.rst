   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to basedata's documentation!
====================================

This text has been included to determine at what point the line begins to wrap text and just how wide this page is set to be. I have a feeling this is just going to keep going and going and going and going until it hits the other side.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   math.rst
   modules.rst
   Articles/article1.rst
   other.rst

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`

.. note:: This is a note.

This is an image embedded on this page. At what width will it be sized? I suspect yes...
